# Chatbot

Chatbot was created using the Flask framework and API.ai. The NLP was processed using API.ai, and Chatbot integrates with API.ai using a webhook. The API.ai documentation can be found here: https://dialogflow.com/docs/reference/agent/

The chatbot was made as an add-on to an existing app, and its main functionality is to automate the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) process in user onboarding.
